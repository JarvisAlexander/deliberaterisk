      <title>What Language Are You Speaking?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before I start exploring the concepts or risk, I need address
how I define commonly used jargon. Essentially,
I want to create a risk vocabulary in which readers can more
clearly understand my work based on how I am using specific words.
 In most instances, this will not be an issue. My goal is to make my
 writing clear and concise. I will strive to use
simpler words and shorter sentences. However, there are certainty commonly
used jargon that I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, any terms that I use will follow the definition
presented in the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cfainstitute.org/learning/tools/glossary/Pages/index.aspx&#34;&gt;CFA Glossary&lt;/a&gt;.
Throughout my writing I will refer various
CFA articles and quote relevant CFA publications when explaining financial
concepts. Mainly because I am a CFA charter holder and a vast majority of my
fundamental knowledge in the area of risk management comes from the study
material that I used while I was a CFA candidate. But also because the CFA
institute and its members have consistently demonstrated a high level of
expertise in various financial subjects and this has translated into the
production of well regarded research and publications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of constantly linking back to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cfainstitute.org/learning/tools/glossary/Pages/index.aspx&#34;&gt;CFA Glossary&lt;/a&gt;,
as I continue to write on various subjects, when there are certain words
or concepts that I either frequently reference or have become the basis to
important discussions I will define them on the &amp;ldquo;Risk Vocabulary&amp;rdquo; page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to all of my work on this blog, the
&lt;a href=&#34;www.deliberaterisk.com/risk-vocab/&#34;&gt;Risk Vocabulary page&lt;/a&gt; is a work in
progress. My hope is that it will always be forward progress.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Welcome to the Deliberate Risk Blog</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my new blog DeliberateRisk.com! My goal is to use this blog as
a platform to document my ideas on risk and risk management. When we think
of risk and risk management we using think of financial risk management (e.g.,
insurance, banking, enterprise) and certainty those are areas that I have
a strong interest in. However given this is my personal blog, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to
be so narrow in my exploration in the concepts of risk. Through this blog, I&amp;rsquo;ll
explore risk in all aspects of life, from career development to fitness &amp;amp; health,
and from raising kids to rest &amp;amp; relaxation. Although inquiries into these areas
may not benefit me monetarily, I believe that the intangible benefit in relation
to:
* A greater understanding the known risk in these areas;
* A better appreciation of the unquantifiable risks;
* Practicing statistical methods; and
* Improving my writing skills in different styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal for this blog is pretty simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a living repository of my work as it relates to the study of risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display my competency in the area of data and risk analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate how risk management is applicable outside of the financial
and business enterprise scope.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create practical applications of risk management as it relates
to a wide range of topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share interesting information (e.g., articles, books, podcasts, etc..)
that contribute to the conversation of risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this blog is my way of pursuing  excellence, as stated so
eloquently in the book the Just City by Jo Walton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that overtime, the work that purse through this blog wil:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved writing skills, both technical and creative;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deeper understanding in the theoretical basis of risk management, general
involving statistics, philosophy, finance, fitness, and
phycology(to name a few); and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me having fun, and continuing to enjoy life to the fullest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DeliberateRisk.com is an attempt to memorialize my ideas and research into
areas of risk measurement and risk management. Whether you think about it or not
the application of risk management is an important part of everyone&amp;rsquo;s life.
Like it or not, most decisions have some sort or risk analysis component to it.
Whether you&amp;rsquo;re shopping for groceries, going to the gym, or working at a job,
every aspect of our life entails a risk decision. I want this blog to be an
exploration on the computer concepts that involve risk measurement, and risk
decisions. This blog will act as a journal of the theories I wish to understand,
ideas I would like to explore, and risk analysis and assessment of which
I would like to master. I&amp;rsquo;m going to play around with applying the concept
of deliberate risk to all areas of ones life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;asset&lt;/strong&gt;: An asset is anything tangible or intangible that is capable
of being owned or produced to create value. In this case we are talking about
investments. An asset class is a group of assets with similar attributes.
Asset classes are not highly correlated with each other and asset with each
class can only fit into one class. Finally, the sum of all assets in each
class should cover the majority of investable assets and contain a sufficient
number of liquid investable assets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
