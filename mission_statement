# Vision Statement
I thought that it would be useful for me to create a vision statement for
myself and the site. This vision statement is a statement of my intent
in regards to the website. My hope is that this statement formally immortalizes
the ultimate goal of the site, as well as the standards that I hold for myself
and anything that is published on this website.

Kind regards,

JarvisA
