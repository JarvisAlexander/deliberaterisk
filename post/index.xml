      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my new blog, DeliberateRisk.com! My goal is to use this blog as a platform to document my ideas on risk and risk management. When we think of risk and risk management we usually think of financial risk management (e.g., insurance, banking, enterprise) and certainty these are areas that I have a strong interest in. However given this is my personal blog, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be so narrow in my exploration of the concepts of risk. Through this blog, I&amp;rsquo;ll explore risk in all aspects of life, from career development to fitness &amp;amp; health; from raising kids to rest &amp;amp; relaxation. Although inquiries into these areas may not benefit me monetarily, I will gain so many intangible benefits including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A greater understanding of risk metrics;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A better appreciation of unquantifiable risks;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deliberate practice with statistical methods and models; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Improvement in my overall writing skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal for this blog is pretty simple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a living repository of my work as it relates to the study of risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Display my competency in the area of data and risk analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate how risk management is applicable outside of the financial and business enterprise disciplines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create practical applications of risk management as it relates
to a wide range of topics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share interesting information (e.g., articles, books, podcasts, etc..) that contribute to the conversation of risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this blog is my way of pursuing excellence, as stated so eloquently in the book the Just City by Jo Walton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope that overtime, the work that I pursue through this blog will lead me to to a:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deeper understanding of the theoretical basis of risk management, related to statistics, philosophy, finance, fitness, and phycology(to name a few); and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Act as an intellectual escape leading to my continued enjoyment of life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
